        "\n",
        "This notebook allows you to create animations by providing text phrases, which are used by an AI to synthesise frames. You can provide values for how much each text phrase should be weighted, and how much zoom, pan, and translation there should be at each keyframe.\n",

        "The VQGAN+CLIP (z+quantize method) notebook this was based on is by Katherine Crowson (https://github.com/crowsonkb, https://twitter.com/RiversHaveWings). The original BigGAN + CLIP method was made by https://twitter.com/advadnoun. Translated into Spanish and added explanations, and modifications by Eleiber#8347, and the friendly interface was made thanks to Abulafia#3734. Translated back into English, and zoom, pan, rotation, and keyframes features by Chigozie Nri (https://github.com/chigozienri, https://twitter.com/chigozienri). Some UI improvements were made by Justin John (https://github.com/justinjohn0306). A linked helper spreadsheet for creating parameter strings is by Kendrick Feller (https://twitter.com/EphemeralInc)\n",

        "# Troubleshooting\n",
        "The most common cause of problems is trying to use a resolution that's too high, which uses up too much memory. Unfortunately the amount of memory Google Colab gives is variable depending on the session, so I can't give an exact figure for how high a resolution you can use. If you are having problems though, try reducing the resolution to 400x400 px, and increasing from there.\n",
        "Two gotchas:\n",
        "1. if you use an input image, this overwrites the resolution you specify.\n",
        "2. You may be able to generate images, but then run into problems at the video generation stage. This is probably also due to a resolution that is too high, because all the memory was used at the image generation stage. If you save the images (if you are using google drive, they will already be saved), restart the kernel completely (Runtime > Manage Sessions > Terminate) and then start again at the video generation stage, you may be able to overcome this.\n",
